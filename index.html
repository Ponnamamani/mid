             <section class="about-content">
                <p>German-born physicist Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, Württemberg, on March 14, 1879, and passed away in Princeton, New Jersey, on April 18, 1955. He is best known for developing the special and general theories of relativity and for explaining the photoelectric effect, which earned him the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics. Most people agree that Einstein was the most significant physicist of the 20th century. </br>
                    The parents of Einstein were middle-class, secular Jews. Hermann Einstein, his father, was a somewhat successful manager of an electrochemical plant after beginning his career as a featherbed salesman. The family home was managed by his mother, the former Pauline Koch. Maria, sometimes known as Maja, was his only sister and was born two years after Albert.

            <h1>EXPERIENCES</h1>
            <p><strong><em>Special Theory of Relativity, 1905 -</em></strong> Special relativity is an explanation of how speed affects mass, time and space.The theory is based on two postulates: 1. The laws of physics are invariant in all inertial frames of reference. 2. The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source or observer.The theory includes a way for the speed of light to define the relationship between energy and matter — small amounts of mass (m) can be interchangeable with enormous amounts of energy (E), as defined by the classic equation <strong>E = mc^2.</strong></p>
            <p><strong><em>General Theory of Relativity, 1916 - </em></strong>General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to other forces of nature. It says gravity is a curving or wraping of space. The more massive an object, the more it wraps the space around it.  </p>
            <p><strong><em>Investigations on Theory of Brownian Movement, 1926 - </em></strong>This time, the subject was the kinetic theory of gases, but the paper was  groundbreaking in its conclusions.It says if tiny but visible particles were suspended in a liquid, the invisible atoms in the liquid would bombard the suspended particles and cause them to jiggle.This motion is named after the botanist Robert Brown.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Why War?, 1933 - </em></strong>A letter to Sigmund Freud. Is there a way of freeing humankind from the threat of war? Can human aggression be channeled to help protect people against the impulses of hatred and destruction? These questions were put to Sigmund Freud in an anxious letter.</p>
            <p><strong><em>The Evolution of Physics, 1938 - </em></strong>he Growth of Ideas from the Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta. This book is incredibly insightful. It is a very conceptual book.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Out of My Later Years, 1950 - </em></strong>In this I gives my personal credos, my profound convictions on the most urgent questions of modern society: social, religious, educational and racial relationships, and the problem of peace.</p>

            <p>Einstein skipped the Nobel Prize ceremonies to take a trip to the Far East.

                “I have decided definitely not to ride around the world so much anymore; but am I going to be able to pull that off, too?” he wrote his sons after his 1922 trip to Japan.
                
                Unlike most of us, for Einstein travel was more than an escape from the mundane: The physicist acknowledges that the assassination that year of Germany’s foreign minister Walther Rathenau by right-wing extremists helped persuade him to leave Germany for a while.
                
                Those same dark forces led to his eventual emigration to the United States from Europe, to escape Hitler’s spreading destruction of Germany’s Jews.Most of my original scientific work appeared as journal articles.</p>
